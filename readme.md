# PURE JS PIG GAME

**GAME RULES:**

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

To start the game:

1. In your terminal, run `npm install` to install all the packages used by this app (only live-server).
2. Run `npm run start-dev` to create a local server and automatically run the game.


Note:  I worked on this project to learn JavaScript and hence it is not original work.
